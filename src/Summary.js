                            enterprise-level websites. This includes taking design proofs and developing them into fully
                            fleshed out experiences. During this time, I took part in building websites, widgets, CMS
                            components, landing pages, and promotional banners. In addition, the sites I helped build were
                            translated into multiple languages by an in-house CMS platform. By taking part in team-driven
                            efforts, I modernized outdated websites by making them scalable and responsive. Working with a
                            team of fellow developers, I completed assignments during long and short-delivery intervals to
                            help drive new business.</p>
